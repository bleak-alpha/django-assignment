        <h3>Hello I'm Sankalp,</h3>
        <p> and currently I'm a college student pursing a degree in computer engineering. Its mostly about 
            how and why computers work the way they do. It is an interesting course for sure, and so far it has 
            is not disappointing, except for mathematics of course (it just find ways to get more complicated).
        </p>
        <p>I had a interest in computer as far as I can remember. First I saw a computer when was in kindergarden, 
            fabergasted to see such a machine it has fueled my passion to learn about it since then.

        <p>For my hobbies, I do a variety of things including indoor stuff like reading 
            books, playing on my computer, or doing hardware maintainence on my computer; and outdoor stuff like long-distance 
            cycling, trekking, playing football and basketball with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>Now during this pandemic I have polished my existing skills and acquired some new skills too.
